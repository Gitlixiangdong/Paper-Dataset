This folder contains two parts: data and program. 
The data contains five parts, the names are "130 150", "150 130", "150 150 150", "150 170" and "170 150", and the meaning of the name is "facet cleats spacing and butt cleats spacing". For example, "130 150" means face cleats spacing are 130 and butt cleats spacing are 150. At the same time, the five files of data contain two '. csv' files, named 'cutting force' and 'crack', which are the cutting force and crack number obtained after the program runs under the current conditions. The program contains six parts, the names are "130 150", "150 130", "150 150 150", "150 170", "170 150" and "CAD". The name of "CAD" means the cutting trajectories obtained according to the conditions of paper. The other five parts are the same as those in "data". In these five parts, each file contains 10 files, namely "1 ball"_ create.p2dat’，‘2 delete_ ball.p2dat’，‘3 contact_ Property. P2dat ','4 cutting. P2dat' and CAD simulation model of conical pick.
